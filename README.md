# Sentio SMTP

**Email inbox API for AI agents.** Give every agent its own real email address,
receive mail as structured webhooks, and reply in-thread over REST - then run
thousands of those inboxes side by side, isolated per tenant.

Agents increasingly need to *be* an email participant: receive a customer
thread, act on it, reply as themselves. That normally means wiring an IMAP
poller to a parser to an SMTP relay, and inheriting a legacy MTA's operational
surface. Sentio is the whole path in one service - an inbox per agent, parsed
and authenticated inbound delivered as a webhook, and sending over the same
API.

```mermaid

    customer([customer]) -- SMTP --> IN
    subgraph Sentio["Sentio · multi-tenant"]
        IN["inbound<br/>authenticate → scan → score → route"]
        OUT["outbound<br/>sign (DKIM) → queue → deliver"]
    end
    IN -- webhook --> agent([your agent])
    agent -- REST --> OUT
    OUT -- SMTP --> customer
```

**Built for platforms.** Tenancy reaches every layer: each domain, mailbox, API
key, rate limit, suppression list, and spam profile belongs to a tenant. If you
run an agentic platform or sell email as a feature, each of your customers gets
isolated sending reputation, their own domains, and their own inboxes on one
deployment.

**It is also a complete mail server.** Sentio implements the full protocol -
inbound and outbound, DKIM/SPF/DMARC/ARC, MTA-STS, DANE, three-tier anti-spam -
so the agent inbox rests on real mail infrastructure rather than a wrapper
around someone else's API.

## Quick start with Docker

The compose stack brings up Sentio plus every service it needs: PostgreSQL,
Redis, NATS/JetStream, MinIO, ClamAV, and rspamd.

**Requirements:** Docker Engine 24+ with the Compose plugin, ~4 GB RAM, ~8 GB disk.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truespar/sentio.git
cd sentio
docker compose up -d
```

That pulls a prebuilt image - `ghcr.io/truespar/sentio`, published for
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` - so there is nothing to compile. To build from
your own checkout instead:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build
```

Expect that to take a while: it is a release build of the whole workspace.
Pin a version with `SENTIO_TAG=1.2.3 docker compose up -d`.

Watch it come up - migrations run once, then the server starts:

```bash
docker compose logs -f sentio-migrate   # schema + bootstrap tenant
docker compose logs -f sentio           # the server
```

Confirm it is healthy:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/health/ready
# {"status":"ok","database":"ok","kv":"ok"}
```

### Bootstrap credentials

Migration `002` seeds one admin tenant and one API key:

| | |
|---|---|
| Tenant ID | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001` |
| API key | `sentio_bootstrap_admin_CHANGE_ME` |

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sentio_bootstrap_admin_CHANGE_ME" \
     localhost:8080/v1/tenants
```

Rotate this key before exposing the host to anything untrusted - it has
wildcard (`*`) scope. Create a replacement via
`POST /v1/tenants/{id}/api-keys`, then delete the bootstrap one.

**The server refuses to start while this key is active** (and refuses to start
if its status cannot be verified, e.g. the database is unreachable). To start
anyway - for recovery or single-user evaluation - set:

```bash
SENTIO_ALLOW_BOOTSTRAP_KEY=1
```

If the shutdown catches you before rotation, rotate manually via SQL, then
start normally:

```sql
-- psql as the Sentio DB user. Create a replacement key first:
--   key_hash is hex(sha256(raw_token)) - generate your token, hash it, insert,
--   then delete the bootstrap row:
INSERT INTO api_keys (id, tenant_id, key_hash, key_prefix, name, scopes)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(),
        '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
        '<hex sha256 of your new token>',
        'admin', 'Rotated Admin', '{*}');
DELETE FROM api_keys WHERE key_prefix = 'sentio_boot';
```

### Ports

| Port | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 25 | SMTP (MX) | Inbound mail from other servers |
| 465 | SMTPS | Implicit TLS - only binds when certificates are present |
| 587 | Submission | STARTTLS |
| 8080 | REST API | Also serves `/openapi.json` |
| 9001 | MinIO console | Optional; remove from compose to hide |

Already running something on port 25 (Postfix, Exim)? Either stop it or remap,
by creating a `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  sentio:
    ports: !override
      - "2525:25"
      - "4465:465"
      - "5587:587"
      - "8080:8080"
```

`!override` replaces the port list instead of appending to it. The file is
gitignored and loaded automatically.

### TLS

No certificates ship with the image, so Sentio starts in plaintext and skips
port 465. Mount a certificate and key to enable TLS:

```yaml
services:
  sentio:
    volumes:
      - ./tls:/etc/sentio/tls:ro   # expects cert.pem and key.pem
```

### Shutting down

```bash
docker compose down       # stop, keep data
docker compose down -v    # stop and delete all volumes
```

---

## Installing without Docker

### Requirements

**Build toolchain**

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Rust stable | Edition 2021. Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) |
| `cmake` | Needed by `aws-lc-rs`, the rustls crypto backend |
| `libclang-dev` | Needed by bindgen-based dependencies |
| A C toolchain | `build-essential` or equivalent |

**Required services**

| Service | Default address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL 18+ | `localhost:5432` | All persistent state |
| Redis or Valkey | `localhost:6379` | Rate limits, bans, greylist, reputation |
| NATS with JetStream | `localhost:4222` | Delivery, retry, webhook, and event pipelines |
| S3-compatible storage | `localhost:9000` | Raw `.eml` and attachment blobs |

PostgreSQL 18 is a hard floor: the schema uses `uuidv7()`, which arrived as a
built-in in 18. On an older server the migration stops with
`function uuidv7() does not exist`, which does not otherwise explain itself.
Check with `psql -tAc 'SHOW server_version'` before you start.

Any S3-compatible endpoint works - AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, SeaweedFS,
Ceph. For NATS, JetStream must be enabled (`nats-server -js`); Sentio creates
its own streams on startup.

All four are required, and Sentio exits at startup if the KV store or the queue
is unreachable. Install them before step 6, or run just those four from the
compose file and keep Sentio itself on the host:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis nats minio
```

**Optional services** - Sentio degrades gracefully if these are absent.

| Service | Default address | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| ClamAV (`clamd`) | `localhost:3310` | Attachments are not virus-scanned |
| rspamd | `localhost:11333` | Falls back to the built-in Rust scorer |

### 1. Install build dependencies

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libclang-dev pkg-config

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ cmake clang-devel pkgconf

# macOS
brew install cmake llvm
```

### 2. Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truespar/sentio.git
cd sentio
cargo build --release
```

The binary lands at `target/release/sentio-smtp`.

Compile-time-checked SQL is served from the committed `.sqlx/` cache, so no
database is needed to build. If you change a query, regenerate it with a live
database:

```bash
echo 'DATABASE_URL=postgres://sentio:sentio@localhost:5432/sentio' > .env
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace
```

### 3. Create the database

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt sentio
sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=sentio sentio
```

`--pwprompt` asks for a password interactively. It has to match the one in
`database.url`, which ships as `sentio`. To script it, or to use a different
password, set both together:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE ROLE sentio LOGIN PASSWORD 'sentio';"
sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=sentio sentio
```

### 4. Apply migrations

The binary embeds its migrations and applies them in order:

```bash
./target/release/sentio-smtp --config config/default.toml migrate
```

This creates the schema and seeds the bootstrap tenant and API key described
[above](#bootstrap-credentials).

### 5. Configure

Copy the shipped defaults and edit:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/sentio
sudo cp config/default.toml /etc/sentio/sentio.toml
```

At minimum set `server.hostname`, `database.url`, and the `[storage]`
credentials. See [Configuration](#configuration).

### 6. Run

```bash
./target/release/sentio-smtp --config /etc/sentio/sentio.toml serve
```

This needs PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS and the object store already running - see
[Requirements](#requirements).

Binding ports below 1024 as a non-root user needs the capability rather than
root. Grant it on whichever copy you are running:

```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' target/release/sentio-smtp
```

Under systemd this is unnecessary - the unit grants
`AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` instead.

### 7. Run as a service

A unit file is included at [`deploy/sentio-smtp.service`](deploy/sentio-smtp.service):

```bash
sudo useradd --system --home-dir /var/lib/sentio --shell /usr/sbin/nologin sentio
sudo install -d -o sentio -g sentio /var/lib/sentio
sudo cp target/release/sentio-smtp /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp deploy/sentio-smtp.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now sentio-smtp
journalctl -u sentio-smtp -f
```

The unit runs as the `sentio` user created above and reads
`/etc/sentio/sentio.toml`, so make that file readable by it. Check the
`Requires=`/`After=` lines before enabling: they name `postgresql.service`,
`nats.service` and `redis-server.service`, and systemd refuses to start a unit
whose `Requires=` target does not exist. Drop or rename any you run
differently - in a container, on another host, or under a different unit name.

---

## Configuration

TOML, with every value overridable by environment variable. The env form is
`SENTIO__SECTION__KEY` - a double underscore between levels, uppercased:

```bash
SENTIO__DATABASE__URL="postgres://sentio:secret@db.internal:5432/sentio"
SENTIO__SERVER__HOSTNAME="mail.example.com"
SENTIO__STORAGE__SECRET_KEY="…"
SENTIO__SPAM__RSPAMD__URL="http://127.0.0.1:11333"   # [spam.rspamd] url
```

Environment overrides win over the file, which makes secrets easy to keep out
of config: leave them unset in TOML and inject them at runtime.

Key sections:

| Section | Controls |
|---|---|
| `[server]` | Hostname, listener addresses, worker counts, session limits |
| `[tls]` | Certificate paths, minimum version, SNI, optional ACME |
| `[database]` | PostgreSQL URL and pool sizing |
| `[kv]` / `[redis]` | KV backend selection and connection |
| `[nats]` | JetStream URL, prefetch, stream retention |
| `[storage]` | S3 endpoint, credentials, bucket, path-style addressing |
| `[scanning]` | ClamAV host, size limits |
| `[spam]` | Backend choice, score thresholds |
| `[abuse]` | Rate limits, DNSBLs, greylisting, reputation thresholds |
| `[delivery]` | Retry schedule, connection pooling, optional smart-host relay |
| `[auth]` | DKIM/SPF/DMARC/ARC behaviour |
| `[llm]` | Provider, model, and when classification runs |
| `[observability]` | Log format and level, metrics, tracing |
| `[tracking]` | Open and click tracking, branded tracking domains |
| `[webhooks]` | Event dispatch: signing, retries, concurrency caps |
| `[deliverability]` | FBL/ARF handling, BATV, one-click unsubscribe |
| `[analytics]` | Rollup and retention for engagement data |
| `[error_events]` | Error capture and how long it is kept |
| `[listmonk]` | Optional bounce bridge to a Listmonk instance |

Defaults live in [`config/default.toml`](config/default.toml); the container
image ships [`config/oss.toml`](config/oss.toml).

---

## API reference and testing UI

The server documents itself. Two endpoints, both live as soon as it starts:

| Endpoint | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/docs` | Interactive API reference with a built-in request client |
| `/openapi.json` | The OpenAPI 3.1 document - 116 operations across 85 paths |

Open <http://localhost:8080/docs> and you get every endpoint with its schemas,
examples, and a **Test Request** button that calls your running server. Set the
bearer token once in the auth panel and you can exercise the whole API from the
browser without writing a line of curl.

The page is self-contained: its front-end bundle is embedded in the binary
and served by Sentio itself, so `/docs` renders fine on a host with no
outbound internet access.

A generated copy of the specification is committed at
[`docs/openapi.json`](docs/openapi.json), so you can read the API, diff it
across versions, or generate a client without starting anything. Export it
yourself at any time - no config, database, or network required:

```bash
cargo run -- openapi > openapi.json          # from source
docker compose exec sentio sentio-smtp openapi   # from the container
```

Because it is a standard OpenAPI document, the usual generators work directly:

```bash
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
    -i docs/openapi.json -g typescript-fetch -o ./client
```

### What the API covers

| Group | Ops | What it covers |
|---|--:|---|
| Messages | 9 | Submit single, batch, raw, or multipart mail; read status, events, and raw source |
| Domains | 7 | Register sending/receiving domains, fetch the DNS records to publish, verify them |
| Mailboxes | 5 | Per-address inboxes on a domain, with forwarding and auto-reply |
| Inbound Routes | 4 | Match inbound mail (exact, domain, regex, catch-all) to a webhook |
| Tenants | 6 | Create and manage tenants, tiers, and status |
| API Keys | 3 | Scoped keys per tenant |
| SMTP Credentials | 4 | Username/password pairs for SMTP submission (argon2-hashed) |
| OAuth | 5 | OAuth 2.0 clients - authorization code with PKCE, and client credentials |
| DKIM Keys | 5 | Generate, rotate, and retire signing keys; export the DNS record |
| Webhooks | 7 | Subscribe to delivery and engagement events, HMAC-signed with retries |
| Suppressions | 5 | Bounce, complaint, and unsubscribe lists; check an address before sending |
| IP Pools | 12 | Dedicated and shared pools, tenant assignment, and IP warmup schedules |
| Reputation | 3 | Per-IP and per-domain reputation scores |
| Abuse | 8 | IP bans, whitelists, and reputation controls for the connection tier |
| Spam Training | 2 | Train the Bayesian classifier on spam and ham |
| Tracking | 2 | Open-pixel and click-redirect endpoints |
| Tracking Domains | 7 | Branded CNAME tracking domains with managed certificates |
| Queues | 4 | Inspect depth, list deferred mail, pause and resume delivery |
| Reports | 7 | Ingest and read DMARC aggregate, FBL/ARF, and TLS-RPT reports |
| Analytics | 4 | Delivery, engagement, and volume summaries |
| Errors | 3 | Captured error events with a summary endpoint |
| Health | 2 | Liveness and readiness probes |

116 operations across 85 paths.

Authentication is a bearer token on every `/v1/**` route:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

## MCP: give agents email as native tools

`sentio-mcp` is a standalone [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server that exposes the REST API as agent-callable tools, so MCP clients
(Claude Desktop, Cursor, opencode, ...) get email capabilities without writing
any integration code. It talks stdio, authenticates with a regular API key scoped to one
tenant, and inherits all of Sentio's existing auth and rate limiting.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_messages` | List recent inbound/outbound messages |
| `get_message` | Fetch one message by ID |
| `send_message` | Send from an owned domain address |
| `reply_message` | Reply in-thread (sets In-Reply-To/References) |
| `list_mailboxes` | List mailboxes on a domain |
| `create_mailbox` | Create a mailbox on an owned domain |

Every release ships `sentio-mcp` as its own archive for Linux x86_64, Linux
aarch64 and Windows x86_64, so an MCP client host needs no Rust toolchain:

```bash
VERSION=0.1.6   # or whatever the latest release tag is
curl -LO "https://github.com/truespar/sentio/releases/download/v${VERSION}/sentio-mcp-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz"
tar -xzf sentio-mcp-*.tar.gz
```

Or build it from a checkout:

```bash
cargo build --release -p sentio-mcp
```

Either way, point it at a running Sentio. It keeps no state of its own:

```bash
SENTIO_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" \
SENTIO_API_KEY="your-api-key" \
./sentio-mcp
```

Wire it into an MCP client config (example for Claude Desktop / opencode):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentio": {
      "command": "/path/to/sentio-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SENTIO_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "SENTIO_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Give an agent its own inbox

A **mailbox** is an address that belongs to a tenant's domain. Give each agent
one, and mail addressed to it arrives at your webhook already parsed,
authenticated, and scored.

```bash
KEY="sentio_bootstrap_admin_CHANGE_ME"
API="http://localhost:8080"
TENANT="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"

# 1. A receiving domain for this tenant
DOMAIN_ID=$(curl -s -X POST "$API/v1/domains" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"domain_name":"acme.example.com","use_for_receiving":true,"use_for_sending":true}' \
  | jq -r .data.id)

# 2. One mailbox per agent. metadata is yours - put the agent id in it.
curl -X POST "$API/v1/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/mailboxes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "address": "support-agent",
    "display_name": "Acme Support Agent",
    "metadata": {"agent_id": "agt_01H8..."}
  }'

# 3. Route the domain to your application
curl -X POST "$API/v1/tenants/$TENANT/inbound-routes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "match_type": "domain",
    "pattern": "acme.example.com",
    "webhook_url": "https://your-platform.example.com/hooks/inbound",
    "priority": 100
  }'
```

`support-agent@acme.example.com` is now live. Inbound mail is SPF/DKIM/DMARC
verified, virus-scanned, and spam-scored *before* your webhook fires, and those
verdicts arrive with the payload - so an agent never has to reason about
whether a sender was forged.

### Replying in thread

Pass the inbound `Message-ID` back as `in_reply_to` and the reply threads
correctly in the recipient's client:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/v1/messages/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "support-agent@acme.example.com",
    "to": ["customer@example.net"],
    "subject": "Re: Order #1234",
    "text": "Refund processed - you should see it in 3-5 days.",
    "in_reply_to": "<abc123@example.net>",
    "references": ["<abc123@example.net>"]
  }'
```

Outbound is DKIM-signed with the tenant's own key, so replies authenticate as
the customer's domain rather than yours.

### Useful mailbox options

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `metadata` | Free-form JSON - the natural place for your `agent_id` |
| `forward_to` | Forward inbound mail on to external addresses (see below) |
| `auto_reply` | Immediate acknowledgement, threaded via `In-Reply-To`, while the agent works |
| `status` | `disabled` stops delivery without deleting history |

### Forwarding a mailbox to external addresses

Set `forward_to` and everything arriving at that mailbox is forwarded on, to any
address anywhere - a personal Gmail account, a shared team inbox, a helpdesk:

```bash
curl -X PUT "$API/v1/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/mailboxes/$MAILBOX_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "address": "support-agent",
    "forward_to": ["oncall@gmail.com", "team@helpdesk.example.net"]
  }'
```

Forwarding is where most mail servers quietly break DMARC: they relay the
message unchanged, so the original `From:` no longer aligns with the forwarding
host's SPF, and the receiver rejects it. Sentio rewrites the envelope instead -
`From:` becomes the mailbox, and the message is re-signed with that domain's
DKIM key, so it authenticates as yours and survives the trip. The
original sender is preserved in `Reply-To:` and `Resent-From:`, so hitting reply
still answers the person who wrote in, and `Resent-To:` / `Resent-Date:` record
the hop per RFC 5322. The body is untouched.

That combination makes forwarding useful for more than escalation: point a
mailbox at a human while an agent is being tuned, fan one address out to a
team, or run a catch-all that lands in an inbox somebody already reads. Pair it
with `auto_reply` to acknowledge the sender immediately while the mail is on its
way to a human.

Give the forwarding domain its own DKIM key. Re-signing is what makes the
rewritten `From:` authenticate; without an active key the forward still goes
out, just unsigned.

### Scaling to many tenants

Create a tenant per customer, then give each its own domains, mailboxes, and
API key:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/v1/tenants" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Acme Corp","tier":"shared_premium"}'

curl -X POST "$API/v1/tenants/$NEW_TENANT_ID/api-keys" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Acme production","scopes":["*"]}'
```

Tiers (`dedicated`, `shared_premium`, `shared_standard`) select the isolation
level, including whether the tenant sends from a dedicated IP pool. Rate limits,
suppression lists, and Bayesian spam profiles are all per-tenant, so one noisy
customer cannot spend another's reputation.

---

## Sending your first message

Outbound requires a **verified** sending domain, which proves you control it.

```bash
KEY="sentio_bootstrap_admin_CHANGE_ME"
API="http://localhost:8080"
auth=(-H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json')

# 1. Register the domain. Keep the id and the verification token it returns.
read -r DOMAIN_ID TOKEN < <(curl -s -X POST "$API/v1/domains" "${auth[@]}" \
  -d '{"domain_name":"example.com","use_for_sending":true}' \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin)["data"]; print(d["id"], d["verification_token"])')

# 2. Create a DKIM key. Do this before step 3: the DNS records only include a
#    DKIM entry once a key exists.
curl -X POST "$API/v1/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/dkim-keys" "${auth[@]}" \
  -d '{"selector":"s1"}'

# 3. Get the records to publish, then publish them at your DNS host
curl "${auth[@]}" "$API/v1/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/dns-records"

# 4. Claim the domain. This checks the token, not DNS.
curl -X POST "$API/v1/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/verify" "${auth[@]}" \
  -d "{\"token\":\"$TOKEN\"}"

# 5. Check what has actually propagated
curl -X POST "$API/v1/domains/$DOMAIN_ID/dns-check" "${auth[@]}"

# 6. Send
curl -X POST "$API/v1/messages/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "hello@example.com",
    "to": ["someone@elsewhere.com"],
    "subject": "Sent with Sentio",
    "text": "Plain text body",
    "html": "<p>HTML body</p>"
  }'
```

### Verified, and DNS-checked, are different things

`POST /v1/domains/{id}/verify` marks the domain verified by matching the token
returned at registration. It performs no DNS lookup, and it is what gates
sending - `status` moves to `verified` and `/v1/messages/send` starts accepting
the domain.

`POST /v1/domains/{id}/dns-check` is the one that resolves your published
records and fills in `spf_status`, `dkim_status`, `dmarc_status` and
`mx_status`, each with an error string when it fails:

```json
{"spf_status": "failed", "spf_error": "no TXT records on example.com",
 "dkim_status": "failed", "dkim_error": "s1._domainkey.example.com not found"}
```

A domain can be `verified` while every DNS check is still failing. That
combination sends, but the mail will not authenticate - so run the DNS check
after publishing and read the per-record errors. Sentio also re-runs it
periodically in the background.

Also available: `/v1/messages/send-batch` (up to 500), `/v1/messages/send-raw`
(pre-built EML), and `/v1/messages/send-multipart` (file upload). Delivery
status and per-message events come from `/v1/messages/{id}` and
`/v1/messages/{id}/events`.

The full API - 116 operations across 85 paths - is described by the OpenAPI
document the server serves at `/openapi.json`.

## Receiving mail

Register a receiving domain, then attach a route that POSTs to your
application when mail arrives:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API/v1/domains" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"domain_name":"example.com","use_for_receiving":true}'

curl -X POST "$API/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/inbound-routes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "match_type": "domain",
    "pattern": "example.com",
    "webhook_url": "https://your-app.example.com/hooks/inbound",
    "priority": 100
  }'
```

`match_type` is one of `exact`, `domain`, `regex`, or `catch_all`; lower
`priority` wins, and the first match stops the search. A `regex` pattern that
fails to compile is logged and skipped rather than failing the delivery.

### What the webhook actually receives

The payload is **metadata, not content**. It identifies the message and carries
the verdicts, then points at the stored original:

```json
{
  "message_id": "01a0…", "tenant_id": "…", "domain_id": "…",
  "envelope_from": "sender@example.net",
  "envelope_to": ["support@example.com"],
  "raw_eml_key": "…",
  "spam_score": -0.1, "spam_action": "accept",
  "llm_category": null, "llm_summary": null,
  "in_reply_to": null, "references": [],
  "auto_submitted": null, "list_id": null, "precedence": null,
  "dsn_ret": null, "dsn_envid": null, "dsn_notify": null, "dsn_orcpt": null,
  "queued_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

There are **no bodies and no attachments in the payload.** Fetch the content
when you want it:

| You want | Call |
|---|---|
| The original message | `GET /v1/messages/{message_id}/raw` |
| Attachment list | `GET /v1/messages/{message_id}/attachments` |
| One attachment | `GET /v1/messages/{message_id}/attachments/{id}` |
| Stored metadata | `GET /v1/messages/{message_id}` |

That split is deliberate: a webhook stays small and fast regardless of a 25 MB
attachment, and a handler that only needs the spam verdict never moves the
body at all.

Every message is SPF/DKIM/DMARC/ARC verified, virus-scanned and spam-scored
*before* the webhook fires, so `spam_score` / `spam_action` are usable as an
intake gate. `auto_submitted`, `list_id` and `precedence` are the loop guards -
check them before auto-replying, or two mail systems will talk to each other
forever.

### Retries

Your endpoint's response decides what happens next:

| Response | Treated as |
|---|---|
| 2xx | Delivered |
| 5xx, 408, 429 | Transient - retried |
| Any other 4xx | Permanent - not retried |
| Connection error or timeout | Transient - retried |

Retries are scheduled through the queue rather than held in memory, so they
survive a restart of the server. Return 2xx once you have durably accepted the
message and do the work asynchronously; a slow handler earns duplicate
deliveries.

## Beyond sending and receiving

Features that matter once mail is actually flowing, all driven from the same API.

**Engagement tracking.** Open-pixel injection and click-through URL rewriting,
with bot detection so mail-scanner opens are not counted as human ones, plus
device/client parsing. Serve it from your own branded CNAME via
`/v1/tracking-domains` rather than a shared host.

**Suppression management.** Hard bounces and ISP complaint (FBL/ARF) reports
suppress addresses automatically, RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe is honoured,
and `/v1/suppressions` lets you check an address before you spend a send on it.

**Event webhooks.** Distinct from inbound routing: subscribe to lifecycle events
(`delivered`, `bounced`, `deferred`, `dropped`, `opened`, `clicked`,
`unsubscribed`, and more), signed with HMAC-SHA256 in an `X-Sentio-Signature`
header over `{timestamp}.{nonce}.` plus the raw body, with retries, per-endpoint
concurrency caps, delivery logs, and a test-dispatch endpoint. See
[building agents on Sentio](docs/building-agents.md).

**Mailbox forwarding.** Any mailbox can forward to external addresses, with
`From:` rewritten and re-signed so the message keeps authenticating after the
hop, and the original sender kept in `Reply-To:`. See
[above](#forwarding-a-mailbox-to-external-addresses).

**IP pools and warmup.** Assign tenants to dedicated or shared pools and ramp
new addresses on a schedule with per-ISP overrides, instead of sending an
untrusted IP straight to full volume.

**Reports.** DMARC aggregate, FBL/ARF, and TLS-RPT reports are ingested and
readable over the API, so authentication failures and TLS problems surface as
data rather than as unexplained delivery loss.

**Queue control.** Inspect queue depth, list deferred mail, and pause or resume
delivery without stopping the server.

**Observability.** Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces spanning submission
through delivery, structured JSON logs with per-component levels, a per-message
trace ID, and captured error events with a summary endpoint. `/health/live` and
`/health/ready` are the probes; the metrics endpoint is unauthenticated and is
deliberately not published by the compose stack.

## Running a real mail server

Software is the easy half. Mail deliverability depends on DNS and IP
reputation, and skipping this is the usual reason self-hosted mail lands in
spam folders.

**DNS records you need,** for `mail.example.com` serving `example.com`:

| Record | Example | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `A`/`AAAA` | `mail.example.com → 203.0.113.10` | Reachability |
| `MX` | `example.com → 10 mail.example.com` | Where inbound mail goes |
| `PTR` | `203.0.113.10 → mail.example.com` | Reverse DNS; **set by your hosting provider**, not your DNS host |
| `SPF` | `v=spf1 mx -all` | Which hosts may send for the domain |
| `DKIM` | from `/v1/domains/{id}/dns-records` | Signature verification |
| `DMARC` | `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:…` | Alignment policy and reports |

Sentio generates the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for you -
`GET /v1/domains/{id}/dns-records`, which includes the DKIM entry once the
domain has a key - and `POST /v1/domains/{id}/dns-check` resolves them and
reports which ones are actually visible.

**Two things that catch people out:**

- **Port 25 outbound is blocked** by most residential ISPs and by several cloud
  providers by default (AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle, and Hetzner all restrict it).
  You may need to request a limit lift, or relay through a smart host -
  see `[delivery.relay]`.
- **Forward and reverse DNS must agree.** Many receivers reject mail from a host
  whose `PTR` does not resolve back to its address. Only your hosting provider
  can set `PTR`.

## Testing

Unit tests need no infrastructure:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

An end-to-end harness exercises both directions against a running stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
scripts/e2e/run-e2e.sh
```

It sends real mail into the SMTP listener from the host and asserts that it is
stored and routed, then submits via the API and asserts the delivered message
reaches the sink carrying a DKIM signature. Captured outbound mail is
browsable at <http://localhost:8025>.

Nothing escapes to the internet: the overlay enables `[delivery.relay]`, which
bypasses MX resolution entirely, and all fixtures use the reserved `.test` TLD.
`scripts/e2e/smtp-send.py` also works standalone for poking at a running
server. See [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

## Architecture

A Rust workspace of 13 crates:

| Crate | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `sentio-core` | Shared types, error model, configuration, repository traits |
| `sentio-store` | PostgreSQL repositories and the Redis KV pool |
| `sentio-smtp-server` | Inbound SMTP state machine, TLS, SASL AUTH |
| `sentio-smtp-client` | Outbound delivery, MX resolution, connection pooling |
| `sentio-auth` | DKIM, SPF, DMARC, ARC, MTA-STS, DANE, BIMI |
| `sentio-queue` | NATS/JetStream producers and consumers |
| `sentio-storage` | S3-compatible blob storage, ClamAV scanning |
| `sentio-spam` | rspamd integration and the built-in scoring engine |
| `sentio-abuse` | Rate limiting, IP bans, greylisting, reputation |
| `sentio-llm` | LLM classification (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, TypeSafe Jev) |
| `sentio-webhooks` | HMAC-signed event dispatch with retries |
| `sentio-observe` | Structured logging, Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry |
| `sentio-api` | Axum REST API with generated OpenAPI |

**Anti-spam runs in three tiers,** so expensive checks only see traffic that
cheap ones could not decide:

1. **Connection level**, sub-millisecond - IP bans, connection and AUTH rate
   limits, DNSBL lookups, greylisting, reputation scoring, reverse DNS.
2. **Content scoring**, tens of milliseconds - rspamd or the built-in engine:
   Bayesian classification, fuzzy hashes, URL reputation, header heuristics.
3. **LLM labelling**, opt-in per inbound route - a route with
   `llm_classify = true` has its messages labelled by the configured backend.
   A score-band helper exists (`classifier.rs`, `score_llm_review_min`..
   `score_llm_review_max`) to consult a model only for borderline scores, but
   nothing calls it yet, so labelling today depends on the route rather than
   on the score.

Four backends serve that third tier: Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama and TypeSafe
Jev. Each one labels the message; the spam score itself is not changed.

### TypeSafe Jev

Jev is a structured-decision model - typed questions in, calibrated
probabilities out, no prose. It labels a message with a category and, unlike
the chat backends, also returns how likely it is to be unsolicited bulk and
how likely it is to be phishing, each with the model's own confidence.

Those land on the message as `llm_category` and `llm_summary` and travel with
the webhook payload, so a consumer can act on them:

```
phishing message  ->  threat,  unsolicited=0.84, phishing=0.88
ordinary message  ->  support, unsolicited=0.16, phishing=0.13
```

```toml
[llm]
enabled = true
provider = "jev"
model = "jev-latest"
base_url = ""               # empty means api.typesafe.ai
api_key_env = "SENTIO_JEV_API_KEY"
temperature = 0.3           # unused by Jev, but the section requires it
max_input_tokens = 2000
classify_inbound = true
classify_outbound = false
auto_respond = false        # required: Jev emits no text, so pairing it
                            # with auto_respond is refused at startup
```

About 660 input tokens per message and output is free, so roughly **$0.03 per
thousand messages** at current pricing.

How much of a message leaves your server is your choice:

| `[llm.jev]` `body_mode` | What is sent |
|---|---|
| `"none"` | Envelope and subject only |
| `"preview"` | Subject plus the first `preview_tokens` of the body (default) |
| `"full"` | Subject plus up to `max_body_tokens` |

The confidence floor and retry budget live in `[llm.jev]` in
[`config/oss.toml`](config/oss.toml), alongside weights for turning those two
probabilities into a spam-score adjustment. The adjustment is computed and
returned, but nothing applies it to a delivery decision yet.

**Standards.** Core SMTP (RFC 5321/5322 and the ESMTP extensions), transport
security (STARTTLS, MTA-STS, DANE, TLS-RPT), authentication (SASL, DKIM, SPF,
DMARC, ARC, BIMI), and deliverability (one-click unsubscribe, FBL/ARF, BATV,
DNSBL/URIBL). Per-RFC notes live in [`docs/`](docs/).
